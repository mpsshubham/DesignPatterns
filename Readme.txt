With Design Patterns instead of code reuse, we get experience reuse
How to learn ?
Load your brain with design patterns and then recognize places in your design and existing applications.
Design pattern give us a shared vocabulary with other developers, easy communication with other developers
Elevates thinking at pattern level, instead gritty object level
============================================================================================================
OO Principles

Encapsulates what varies

Program to an interface(supertype), not an implementation

Favor composition over inheritance

Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

===========================================================================================================
OO Pattern

Strategy pattern defines set of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from client that use it

Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

Decorator Pattern attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorator provide a flexible 
alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
